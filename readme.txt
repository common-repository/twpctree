Taxonomy Trees for posts and custom post types. You can create as many Taxonomies Trees as you want for your posts or custom post types.
Ex: category tree for custom post type.

== Description ==

Chosse between all yours custom taxonomies to create Taxonomy Tress.
You can also order categories, include categories, exclude categories...
The *TWPCTree* widget was written to allow users that don't know their way around PHP to easily show custom taxonomy trees in any way they'd like. 
You can call multiple instances and set up each one independently.

This is the widget that keeps users out of the code and gives them the ability to create multiples Taxonomy Trees for Post and Custom Post types.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why was this plugin created? =

End users sometimes want to do complicated things but don't nave the technical *know-how* of seasoned developers.  This creates a massive barrier between users that can have *really* cool sites and those that have to use what their theme developer gave them.

This plugin is about removing that barrier.


= How do I set it up? =

There's not a lot of work you have to do.  Just add the widget to your theme's widget area(s).
The options are very intuitive. You can see them in the "screenshots"

= Why I have to install RedFruits? =

RedFrutis is a powerfull tool to create plugins for wordpress. Many others plugins use it, like TheWordpressCart, and it doesn't interfere with wordpress.
